# YHM-Weather
A repository of the monthly weather for Hamilton, Ontario, Canada vs climatology.

The code is written in Python to plot a few different visualizations. All that is needed is to change the excel file's location to where you choose to store the file itself. 

For example: 
September = pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\Desktop\September 2023 YHM Data Report.xlsx')

Note:
I had already made the entire month-by-month breakdown onto separate spreadsheets before finding a database that allows you to pick individual dates for the entire year.
I plan to address this going forward, but I'll include the project as is for the moment. 

Example plots:
